    <p class="au-introduction">The HDS is for everyone, but it helps if you're a designer or developer of Health and Aged Care digital products.</p>
</div>

## Designers
If you're a designer but don't build digital products, you can browse the HDS to understand:
- what components are included
- what variants exist
- how they're used to build pages

> We hope to create Figma components that are usable by less technical individuals.

<div class="au-body">    
    <a href="/components/detail/accordion--default" class="au-cta-link">Browse the components</a>
</div>

## Developers
If you're a developer, the HDS is for you. You can:
- integrate the HDS into your product
- browse the components and copy/paste component markup directly
- use the HDS as a prototyping tool, via the Health Design System starter kit.
