The HDS offers a catalogues of accessible, mobile-friendly components ready to use, promoting consistency and saving teams the effort of building everything from scratch for their web design and redesign projects.

Developers can use the system in three ways:

<div class="au-body">
    <div class="health-band getting-started">
        <div class="health-grid health-listing health-grid--3col-md">
            <div class="health-card health-card--shadow health-card--colour-primary">
                <div class="health-card__body">
                    <h2 class="health-card__title">1. Out of the box</h2>
                    <div class="health-card__text">
                        <ul>
                        <li>Simply download and include the CSS and JS files from the folder in your product.</li>
                        <li>Browse the system to understand how to use components.</li>
                        <li>Use the templates as a starting point.</li>
