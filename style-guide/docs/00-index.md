## About the Health Design System

It uses the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au/) as its foundation and provides a set of open-source building blocks that can be used to build government products and services more easily.

### Guiding principles
The guiding principles behind the Health Design System are:

  1. Build upon and document how Health uses the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au/)
  2. Support the delivery of a unified experience for users of Health products
  3. Provide a centralised resource of usable components, patterns and templates
  4. Prevent duplication, fragmentation and *reinvention of the digital wheel*
  5. Be platform agnostic
  6. Eat our own dogfood - build the system and use the system!


The [Department of Health website](https://www.health.gov.au/) uses this system.
