## How to use the system

Developers can use the system in a couple of ways:

### Option 1: Out of the box
* Simply download and include the CSS and JS files from the folder in your product.
* Browse the system to understand how to use components.
* Use the templates as a starting point.
* Copy the HTML from the components to build your product.

### Option 2: Build yourself
* Clone, git submodule or download the source code into your project.
* Compile the code into usable CSS and JS.
* Browse the system to understand how to use components.
* Use the templates as a starting point.
* Copy the HTML from the components to build your product.
