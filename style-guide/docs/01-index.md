## About the Health Design System

It uses the [GOLD Design System](https://gold.designsystemau.org/) as its foundation and provides a set of open-source building blocks that can be used to build government products and services more easily.

### Guiding principles

The guiding principles behind the Health Design System are:

1. Build upon and document how Health uses the [GOLD Design System](https://gold.designsystemau.org/)
2. Support the delivery of a unified experience for users of Health products
3. Provide a centralised resource of usable components, patterns and templates
4. Prevent duplication, fragmentation and _reinvention of the digital wheel_
5. Be platform agnostic
6. Eat our own dogfood - build the system and use the system!
