# Step indicator

Step indicators should be used to:
- present a series of steps (at least 2) that form a process
- represent a timeline or linear sequence

## Fields

Each node can be associated with a variety of fields.

At its simplest, the step title can be used to represent a simple squence. However, more complex ones can include multiple fields, such as date, description and link.

## Variants

The default step indicator uses simple circular 'nodes' to represent elements in a sequence. Two other variants exists:

1. [Numbered](step-indicator--numbered)
2. [Progress](step-indicator--progress)
