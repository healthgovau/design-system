# Field groups

Field groups are wrappers for multiple fields and determine their layout and repsonsive behaviour.

## Variants

There are 2 (and a half) variants:

1. Vertical/stacked (default)
2. Horizontal/inline
   2.5. As 2 but doesn't responsively stack on mobile (to be used only with few fields and short values).

### Rules for application

Field layouts (e.g. stacked/inline) or styles (e.g. label/icon-only) should not be mixed within a group.
