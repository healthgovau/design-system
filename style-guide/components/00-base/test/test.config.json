We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold. Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly. That's right. And my friends out in it. I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker. Then I'll see you in hell!"
